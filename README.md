A simple chrome extension that converts all text in HTML pages to Pig Latin.

## Inspiration
I've wanted to learn how to make a chrome extension for quite a while. I decided a simple extension to begin with would be changing text to Pig Latin.

## Usage
Simply clone the repository into a directory of your choice. Then, open the Chrome browser and go to the Extensions page. From there, click on the "Load unpacked extension..." button and when prompted, choose the repository's directory. The extension should now be installed.

## How to Stop the Madness
Seeing all your pages converted to Pig Latin by default can get pretty annoying. But don't worry, your friend Ananth here will show you just how to get rid of that pesky browser behavior. All you have to do is either disable or uninstall the extension. In the Extensions page of Chrome, just uncheck the Enabled box to disable the extension, and click on the trash icon next to it to uninstall the extension. Easy!
